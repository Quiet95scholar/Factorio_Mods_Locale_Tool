	"description": "你不是第一个来到这里的人,你也不会是最后一个. 偶尔,你会遇到前人留下的遗迹, 某些遗迹的防御系统还在运行, 散落在出生点附近. 你可以探索它们来获取材料/习得科技,但是, 这些遗迹,防御系统也许还在运行, 不过你却不是它的主人...",
	"description_original": "You weren't the first to come here, and you won't be the last. Every so often, you encounter ruins of past failed bases, some even still have running defenses, strewn across the countryside. Explore them for resources and adventure if you wish, but beware, as within these ruins, defensive machinery still whirrs, and you aren't its master..."

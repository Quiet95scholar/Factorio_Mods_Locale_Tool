	"description_original": "A modding utility that generates sound-only effects from any in-game gun entity types so that lua scripts can play gun sounds independently. The effects are explosion-type entities with no visual component. The naming convention is \"gunsound-\"..gun.name. Looping sounds are also supported but have a -begin_sound, -middle_sound, and -end_sound suffix.",

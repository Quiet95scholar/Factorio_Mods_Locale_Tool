	"description_original": "I cant be bothered with the hand mining/crafting first hour \n\n Increased starting equipment to remove hand mining stage of game and jump straight into using trains \n\n Hopefully enough items to get a small factory and power station running. \n\n Doesn't effect research, you will still need to do all of that."

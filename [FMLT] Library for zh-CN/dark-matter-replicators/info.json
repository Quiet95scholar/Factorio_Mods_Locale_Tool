The existence of this version of Replicators is not meant to be disrespectful in any way to darkshadow1809 or Doublespin.  Back when the replicators mod was first abandoned I made my own version based on my own preferences, and seeing what darkshadow1809 and Doublespin have done with the mod inspired me to make even more changes.",

	"description": "Adds replicators which can produce items using only electricity.  The existence of this version of Replicators is not meant to be disrespectful in any way to darkshadow1809 or Doublespin.  Back when the replicators mod was first abandoned I made my own version based on my own preferences, and seeing what darkshadow1809 and Doublespin have done with the mod inspired me to make even more changes.",
	"description_original": "This mod adds replicators, machines which can produce items using nothing but electricity. Lower tiers of replicators are the most energy efficient and can essentially transform depleted, empty land into a resource. Higher tier replicators can simplify production lines or otherwise act as a convenience. Tier 1 replicators can replace depleted mining drills, allowing your expansion to be for growth rather than necessity.",

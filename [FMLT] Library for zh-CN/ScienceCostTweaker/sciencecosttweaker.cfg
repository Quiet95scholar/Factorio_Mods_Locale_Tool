science-pack-1 = Used by Lab for adapting technology to the local environment, this electromagnet is destroyed during use but allows for intricate electromagnetic experiments. (4:1:1)
science-pack-2 = Used by Lab for adapting technology to the local environment, this fragile equipment is destroyed during use but provide keen insight into the local environment's effects upon materials and chemical reactions. (4:1:1)
science-pack-3 = Used by Lab for adapting technology to the local environment, these can manipulate and monitor interactions on an atomic level, but burn themselves out in the process. (4:1:1)
science-pack-4 = Used by Lab for adapting technology to the local environment, these single use items can forge virtual particles to manipulate nearby matter and quantum fields.
alien-science-pack = Used by Lab for adapting technology to the local environment, these living processors can directly manipulate and monitor quantum level interactions, but are destroyed during the hostile research experiments.
